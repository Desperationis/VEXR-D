Robotics is a subject that combines technology, engineering, math, and science to allow machines to do tasks efficiently, safely, and remotely. At John Glenn High School, VEX Robotics is used competitively against other teams at other fellow schools, with its debut only coming recently as of the year 2019. However, with few team members, noviceness, and cruel judges lurking about, triumph over more numerous, more experienced teams with proper education seems unlikely. As such, new methods and research must be deployed in order to make up for our pitfalls at building, programming, and driving a robot, so as to have a fair chance at winning.
