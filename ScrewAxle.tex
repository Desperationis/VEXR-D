\section{Screw Axle}

Take a screw, put two nuts on it, and screw them in opposite directions so that they tighten each other. What you have now is a screw axle, where the screw acts as an axle and the two nuts acts like a shaft collar.

Screw axles can be used to attached anything to a metal part securely while still maintaining a degree of freedom. These can be used to make metal whips (steel bars with screw axles), secure encoders loosely, and possibly more. As encoders require a lot of torque to turn if tightened, securing them with screw axles allow unpowered wheels to turn extremely easily.
