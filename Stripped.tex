Here's a hack on loosening stripped hex screws: use a torx bit. The sharp six pointy edges of the torx catch into the remains of the screw and loosens it no problem. Rubber bands may work sometimes, but a torx bit is the only tool that can fit in shaft collars. 

There's no magic size for these screws; You just have to try different torx standards until one has a good grip. I did discover something else though: The T-8 torx standard fits the small screws perfectly, and the T-10 fits the bigger ones.
