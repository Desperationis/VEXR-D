\begin{abstract}

The 2020-2021 school year has been conducted completely online due to pandemic, leaving a lot of free time to students with the cost of subpar education. It is useless to sit around and wait doing nothing until school comes, which is why this paper was created -- to kill time. Using my knowledge of computer science, electronics, and amateur engineering, I hope to make an enticing paper on the true capabilities of VEX Robotics.
