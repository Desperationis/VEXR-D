\section{IP Camera}

This project proposes two different methods for near realtime, wireless, cheap video transmission. Keep in mind that the research done by this singular project completely dwarfs every single other project in this document; The basics of wireless networks, statistics, and an entirely different operating system had to be learned in the span of 4 months to make this possible.

\section{Mobile IP Camera}

This was my first go-to option for wireless video transmission. Phones are pretty small, have cameras, and nearly everyone in California has one. So, I did a formal experiment between three apps -- Skype, Jami, and IP Webcam -- on three different phones and constructed a histogram of the round-trip latency of each, and picked the best one based on results across hardware; All apps had the most optimal settings at streaming at 480p. The data-collection process, which was automated with a python script and a trained AI over the span of an hour, was simple:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Start a clock on a computer.}
\item{Point the phone, with the app running, on that clock.}
\item{On the computer, view the video feed of the phone and take a screenshot.}
\item{Using the screenshot, find the difference between the video feed's time and the clock's time. This is the round-trip latency. }
\end{enumerate}

These three apps in particular were chosen because they had special, very different network architectures that I believed impacted performance. As you can see from the results, my hypothesis was right. Overall, IP Camera had the lowest average latency of the apps with just 164.80 ms on the Stylo 6, which was the phone with the best specs.

In another, \textit{much} longer experiment, I played around with settings that squeezed performance out of the app while having a usable quality and low bandwidth. The optimum settings were 352x288 video resolution + 20\% Quality, giving an average latency of 135.47 ms with a bandwidth of just 0.9 Mbps. For comparison, the settings used in the former had, on average, 10ms more latency and 1500x more bandwidth usage.
