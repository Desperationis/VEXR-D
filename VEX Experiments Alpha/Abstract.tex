The 2020-2021 school year has been conducted completely online due to pandemic, leaving a lot of free time to students with the cost of subpar education. As a student, I have dedicated most of this time expanding my horizons in electronics, math, and most importantly, computer science by doing small projects and reading books. In this precious, limited amount of time, I hope to apply these skills to VEX Robotics in order to have a competitive edge over other schools.
